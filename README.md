# Microservices Architecture - In-Depth Notes


> **Definition**  
> Microservices architecture is a method of developing software systems as a suite of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service corresponds to a specific business capability and communicates with other services using lightweight mechanisms like HTTP REST, gRPC, or message queues.

## 🏛️ Monolithic Architecture – Overview

> **Monolithic Architecture** is the traditional model of software development where the entire application is built as a single unit. All business logic, data access, and user interface components are tightly coupled and run in the same process.

### 🔑 Characteristics

- **Single codebase** for all functionalities
- **Tightly coupled** components
- **Single database** shared by the whole application
- **Simple to develop initially**, but becomes complex as it grows
- **One deployment unit**

### ⚠️ Limitations

- Difficult to scale specific modules
- High regression risk when updating
- Slower deployment cycles
- Not ideal for large or growing teams

## 🚀 Microservices Architecture – Overview

> Microservices split a large system into multiple independent services. Each is focused on a specific business function, developed and deployed independently.

### 🔑 Characteristics

| Feature                     | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Single Responsibility**   | Each microservice focuses on a specific function or domain. |
| **Independent Deployment**  | Services can be updated and deployed independently. |
| **Decentralized Data**      | Each service manages its own data and database. |
| **Technology Agnostic**     | Different services can use different programming languages and databases. |
| **Lightweight Communication** | Services interact using HTTP/REST, gRPC, or message brokers. |
| **Fault Isolation**         | Failure in one service doesn't crash the whole system. |
| **Scalability**             | Services can scale independently based on demand. |

## 🏗️ Monolithic vs Microservices – Comparison

| Aspect           | Monolithic Architecture          | Microservices Architecture         |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Deployment       | Single unit                      | Independent services               |
| Scaling          | Whole app                        | Per service                        |
| Flexibility      | Low                              | High (use different tech per service) |
| Fault Tolerance  | One failure affects all          | Isolated failures                  |
| Development Speed| Slower with size                 | Faster with independent teams      |

## 🔧 Types of Microservices

### 1. **Database-per-Service**
- Each service owns its own database
- Promotes encapsulation and autonomy
- Example: `UserService` has its own `users_db`, `OrderService` has `orders_db`

### 2. **API Gateway Microservice**
- Entry point for all clients
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices
- Provides load balancing, authentication, and caching

### 3. **Choreographed Microservices (Event-Driven)**
- Services communicate asynchronously via events
- Loose coupling
- Tools: Kafka, RabbitMQ

### 4. **Orchestrated Microservices**
- Central coordinator (orchestrator) controls workflow
- More control over sequencing
- Often used in business process orchestration (e.g., Camunda)

### 5. **Edge/Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)**
- Separate services per UI channel (e.g., mobile vs. web)
- Customizes backend logic per frontend type

## 📦 Real-world Project Examples

### 🔹 Monolithic Project Example – Blog Platform
**Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS

All features (User Auth, Posts, Comments) reside in a single Express app:
```text
/routes
  ├── auth.js
  ├── posts.js
  └── comments.js
/models
  ├── User.js
  ├── Post.js
  └── Comment.js
/views
  ├── home.ejs
  └── dashboard.ejs
app.js
```

- Simple to deploy
- Hard to maintain at scale
- One failure affects all modules

---

### 🔸 Microservices Project Example – E-commerce System
**Tech Stack:** Node.js, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Docker

- `user-service` → Handles sign up/login
- `product-service` → Manages products and inventory
- `order-service` → Handles orders and payments
- `notification-service` → Sends confirmation emails

Each service:
```text
📦 user-service
  ├── app.js
  ├── routes/user.js
  └── models/User.js
📦 product-service
  ├── app.js
  ├── routes/product.js
  └── models/Product.js
...
```

Services communicate via REST or async (RabbitMQ/Kafka)

- Fault isolation
- Independent scaling
- Easier to manage in CI/CD pipelines

---

## 📬 Communication Types

1. **Synchronous:**
   - REST, gRPC (request-response)
2. **Asynchronous:**
   - Message brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ
   - Used for event-driven architecture

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

| Category          | Tools |
|-------------------|-------|
| **API**           | REST, gRPC, GraphQL |
| **Message Broker**| Kafka, RabbitMQ |
| **Containerization** | Docker |
| **Orchestration** | Kubernetes |
| **Service Discovery** | Eureka, Consul |
| **CI/CD**         | Jenkins, GitHub Actions |
| **Monitoring**    | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack |

## ✅ Benefits of Microservices

- Scalability and flexibility
- Better fault isolation
- Faster development cycles
- Smaller codebase per service
- Easy integration with DevOps & CI/CD

---

## ⚠️ Challenges of Microservices

- Complex deployment and orchestration
- Difficult debugging across services
- Need for distributed data consistency
- Increased latency from service hops
- Strong DevOps culture and tooling required

---

## 📚 Best Practices

- Use **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- Design APIs carefully (versioning, consistency)
- Use centralized **logging and monitoring**
- Secure services via API Gateway and token-based auth
- Automate testing and deployment pipelines
